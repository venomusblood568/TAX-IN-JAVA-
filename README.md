# TAX-IN-JAVA-
There are three tax filing statuses: single filers, married filing jointly or qualified widow(er) and married filing separately.  If you are, say, single with a taxable income of  $ 10,000, the first $ 8,350 is taxed at 10% and the other $1,650 is taxed at 15%, so, your total tax is $1,082.50. Write a JAVA code using the case statement for the tax calculation per the given slab.
